This script is to install the Cisco VPN client for linux
on the Kali distrobution. This is all licensed 
under the GPLv3 and is maintained by James Luther.

Recently during a pentest I had to connect to the systems
that were being tested by using a Cisco VPN which only
supported certificate based authentication. This normally
isn't an issue but I use a custom build of Kali during
penetration tests unless we find something specific that 
we want to target which then we move on to one of the 
special/specific linux builds. Either way I couldn't vpn
from the pentesting workstation. Initially I used 
proxychains to make my tools available then I broke down
and did this. I certainly hope it saves some of you time
and effort.  Enjoy!

WARNING!!
=======================================================

If you are running a 64 bit version of Kali you must
install ia32-libs! If you don't install this you will
receive a "No such file or directory" error when
attempting to run the vpnclient or any of the newly
installed cisco software. There is an additional script
in the folder downloaded from git repo that does this 
for you. It is named 64-Bit. This will be incorporated
into the installer script in newer versions. Until
then it needs to be ran manually.

=======================================================
Installing Cisco VPN Client in Kali
=======================================================

1. Clone this repository on your local machine.

2. Run VPN-Installer script.

3. Import user certificates.
	3a. The only certificate needed is the DS p12
	3b. Certificates are imported using:
		cisco_cert_mgr -U -op import
	    Follow the onscreen instructions from there.

4. Copy your connection profile from a windows machine.
	4a. Profile connections are stored:
		C:\Program Files (x86)\Cisco Systems\VPN Client\Profiles
	4b. Copy the connection profile to the Profiles location on Backtrack
		/etc/opt/cisco-vpnclient/Profiles/
    4c. You can also create your own. I'm not going into that though.

5. Edit your Profile Configuration File (.pcf) to show the certificate store used in linux.
	5a. vi /etc/opt/cisco-vpnclient/Profiles/xxxxx.pcf
	5b. The field "CertStore=2" needs to be changed to "CertStore=1"

6. Verify all certificates are installed correctly.
	6a. cisco_cert_mgr -U -op verify
            Follow the on screen instructions and verify all imported certificates
	    cisco_cert_mgr -R -op verify
	    Again, follow the on screen instructions and verify all imported certificates

7. Start the vpn service
	7a. /etc/init.d/vpnclient_init start

8. Connect the vpn
	8a. vpnclient connect xxxx <-- this is the name of your connection profile.  There is no need to put the full path or .pcf
