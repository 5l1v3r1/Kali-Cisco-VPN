This script is to install the Cisco VPN client for linux
on the Backtrack 5 distrobution. This is all licensed 
under the GPLv3 and is maintained by James Luther.

Recently during a pentest I had to connect to the systems
that were being tested by using a Cisco VPN which only
supported certificate based authentication. This normally
isn't an issue but I use a custom build of BT5 during
penetration tests unless we find something specific that 
we want to target which then we move on to one of the 
special/specific linux builds. Either way I couldn't vpn
from the pentesting workstation. Initially I used 
proxychains to make my tools available then I broke down
and did this. I certainly hope it saves some of you time
and effort.  Enjoy!

Installing Cisco VPN Client in BT5 R3
=======================================================

1. Clone this repository on your local machine.
	1a. Extract tar and verify tar contents:
		vpnclient-linux-x86_64-4.8.02.0030-k9.tar.gz
		ciscovpn-bt5.patch

2. Run VPN-Installer script.

3. Import user certificates.
	3a. The only certificate needed is the DS p12
	3b. Certificates are imported using:
		cisco_cert_mgr -U -op import
	    Follow the onscreen instructions from there.

4. Copy your connection profile from magicdesk machine.
	4a. Profile connections are stored:
		C:\Program Files (x86)\Cisco Systems\VPN Client\Profiles
	4b. Copy the connection profile to the Profiles location on Backtrack
		/etc/opt/cisco-vpnclient/Profiles/

5. Edit your Profile Configuration File (.pcf) to show the certificate store used in linux.
	5a. vi /etc/opt/cisco-vpnclient/Profiles/xxxxx.pcf
	5b. The field "CertStore=2" needs to be changed to "CertStore=1"

6. Verify all certificates are installed correctly.
	6a. cisco_cert_mgr -U -op verify
            Follow the on screen instructions and verify all imported certificates
	    cisco_cert_mgr -R -op verify
	    Again, follow the on screen instructions and verify all imported certificates

7. Start the vpn service
	7a. /etc/init.d/vpnclient_init start

8. Connect the vpn
	8a. vpnclient connect xxxx <-- this is the name of your connection profile.  There is no need to put the full path or .pcf
